ASU Student Club Attendance
===========================
This is a Ruby on Rails project that takes attendance for ASU clubs. This is released under the
[Creative Commons 3.0 Unported Liscense](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

I developed this project a while back ago. I no longer have time to work on this project and I wish
for someone else to improve on this project.
## About This Project
This project was designed to alleviate a common problem among clubs at ASU - attendance. Whether it
be a recruitment meeting or a normal meeting, this project makes it easy and quick to keep track of
who shows up to meetings.

Once you are signed in, you can create a club and create meetings for your club. Once you've created a
meeting, you can select a "Take Attendance" button. This will take you to a simple page where a student
only needs to type his ASURITE ID and press "enter." Just simply leave a laptop in an obvious location
and you're good to go!

After the meeting is over, you can see who has attended the meeting, including a special column for
new members.

## Request Features
Some features I would like to see, if someone takes over this project:
* Support for multiple administrators for a single club
* Easy to access profile page (simple task, since this is using Devise)
* Automatic Listserv enrollment
* Statistics
